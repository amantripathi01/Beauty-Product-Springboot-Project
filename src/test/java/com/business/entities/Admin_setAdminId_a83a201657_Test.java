Test generated by RoostGPT for test java_spring_17Jan using AI Type Open AI and AI Model gpt-4

Test Scenario 1: Valid Admin Id
- Description: Pass a valid Admin Id to the `setAdminId` method and check if it is correctly set.

Test Scenario 2: Negative Admin Id
- Description: Pass a negative value to `setAdminId` method and check the behavior, as Admin Ids are usually positive.

Test Scenario 3: Zero as Admin Id
- Description: Pass zero as a parameter to `setAdminId` method and check the behavior, as Admin Ids are usually non-zero.

Test Scenario 4: Very Large Admin Id
- Description: Pass a very large number as Admin Id to test the upper limit of the field.

Test Scenario 5: Null Admin Id
- Description: Attempt to pass a null value to the `setAdminId` method and check the behavior.

Test Scenario 6: Non-integer Admin Id
- Description: Try passing a non-integer value (like a string or a floating point number) to the `setAdminId` method and observe the behavior.

Test Scenario 7: Admin Id as a special character
- Description: Pass special characters as Admin Id and observe the behavior.

Please note that the behavior in Scenarios 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7 should ideally throw an error or exception, since those are invalid inputs. However, as it is not defined in your method, it might just set the invalid values. It is more about how your method handles these situations.
